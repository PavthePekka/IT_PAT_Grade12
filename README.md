# IT_PAT_Grade12
My Grade 12 IT PAT ( Please Note this is not the final Version, as I still plan to tweak that before uploading it)
This is a programme that I designed for my school's environmental club, it's still in development but I hope to have it complete by the end of this year. At this point all of the code has been done 
(with the exception of some online functionality which I would like to add at a later stage) , however the GUI is pretty barebones and I plan to give the whole thing a rehaul before next year so that my
school can use this programme for the 2024 environmental club. 

Features:
- I've used inheritence to form two child classes ,TStudent and TUser, which both inherit from the TPerson parent class
- I've used Graphs to represent my data visually in the Analytics_u unit
- I've designed a "text to speech system" which I've incorporated with my captcha
- Ive added some search bars in the DutyRoster_u, StudentInfo_u and Attendence_u units for user conveiniance
- Supports both User and Admin priveledges
- Has a "Remember me" feature so that you dont have to keep logging in"
